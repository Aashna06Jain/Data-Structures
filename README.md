# ðŸ“š DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repository contains clean, well-commented C++ implementations of various DSA concepts including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

Each topic is organized with practical code examples and clear structure to help reinforce learning and problem-solving skills.

### âœ… Implemented Topics

- ðŸ“Œ **Arrays**
  - Basic operations
  - Search and sort algorithms
- ðŸ“Œ **Stacks**
  - Stack using array
  - Stack using linked list
- ðŸ“Œ **Queues** (coming soon)
- ðŸ“Œ **Linked Lists** (coming soon)
- ðŸ“Œ **Trees** (coming soon)
- ðŸ“Œ **Recursion and Backtracking** (coming soon)
- ðŸ“Œ **Greedy Algorithms**
- ðŸ“Œ **Dynamic Programming** (planned)

> ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. More topics and problems will be added regularly.

## ðŸ§  Why This Repo?

This repo is for:
- Practicing standard DSA problems
- Preparing for coding interviews
- Building a reference base for C++ implementations
